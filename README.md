CS4460 - Crime Data
===================

Running the Project
---

Run a local server at the project directory, for example:

```
python -m"SimpleHTTPServer"
```

index.html is the page for the visualization. mapScript.js and map.html were used in development but are not used in the final visualization. dataFormatConverter.py was used to parse the data, but is not needed to run the visualization.
